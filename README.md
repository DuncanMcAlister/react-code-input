# react-code-input

A lightweight component that turns `<input type="text" />` into a mini code editor.

Provides basic tokenisation, syntax highlighting, linting, and code completion for simple code expressions.

There are zero dependencies and you can style the input in any way that you want.

## Quick start

```tsx
import { CodeInput } from '@djgrant/react-code-input';

export default () => (
  <CodeInput
    placeholder="price - vat"
    operators={['+', '-', '/', '*']}
    variables={['price', 'vat']}
    customInputComponent={MyInput}
    style={{ width: '300px' }}
    onChange={event => {
      console.log(event.tokens);
      console.log(event.currentTarget.value);
    }}
  />
);
```

## Development

At present, the component's understanding of code is very naive. I wrote it for a particular use-case but recognise that it could have broader use. So, if you have ideas about how it should be developed, open an issue :)
